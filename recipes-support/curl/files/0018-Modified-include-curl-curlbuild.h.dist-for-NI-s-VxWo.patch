Subject: [PATCH 18/22] Modified include/curl/curlbuild.h.dist for NI's VxWorks
 distribution

Added VxWorks case to GCC entry.

The only difference between the NI VxWorks case and x86 is CURL_FORMAT_OFF_T,
which is "%ld" because sizeof(off_t) is 4 bytes which is equal to sizeof(long).
See: //user/hokanovi/hTestComponent/1.0/source/test_types.cpp

NOTE: File include/curl/curlbuild.h.dist defines various type properties
for compiler/CPU combinations that don't support Autoconf.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [configuration]
