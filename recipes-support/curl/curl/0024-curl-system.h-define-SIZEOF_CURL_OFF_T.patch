Subject: [PATCH] curl/system.h: define CURL_SIZEOF_CURL_OFF_T

This value is detected via the autotools or cmake build logic, but we
don't use those in nibuild (we wrote our own build logic independent of
upstream to support systems where it's impossible to run autotools or
cmake). The value is aways 8 for all platforms.

This patch is the last remnant from the nibuild curlbuild.h.$(MACHINE)
files (curl upstream removed curlbuild.h in https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/1383).

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [configuration]
